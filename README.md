- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a JavaScript programmer and web developer. 
- I’m interested in Web3 development, e-commerce, and wherever these two worlds meet. I'm also working on some new concepts for "social" media.
- I’m currently learning Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites, dApps, and Ethereum smart contracts!

You can learn more about me in my blog/resume/portfolio I'm building @ https://land.on.fleek.co/

It's currently under construction, so you might not see much yet. Check back soon if things look a little wonky.

Thanks for stopping in to check out my code.
