- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a JavaScript programmer and web developer. 
- I’m interested in Web3 development, e-commerce, and wherever these two worlds meet. I'm also working on some new concepts for "social" media.
- I’m currently learning Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites, dApps, and Ethereum smart contracts!

You can learn more about me in my blog/resume/portfolio I'm building @ https://land.on.fleek.co/

It's currently under construction, so you might not see much yet. Check back soon if things look a little wonky.

I'm also building JAM stack starters on Fleek, and will be creating instructional blogs going forward. The world needs more documentation on JAM stack in Web3, it must be done. 

Please feel free to clone and reuse any "starters" you see. They will typically be labled as starters or have an active deploy in the README file. 

Thanks for stopping in to check out my code.
