- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a JavaScript programmer and web developer. 
- I’m interested in Web3 development, e-commerce, and wherever these two worlds meet. I'm also working on some new concepts for "social" media.
- I’m currently learning Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites, dApps, and Ethereum smart contracts!

You can learn more about me in my blog/resume/portfolio I'm building @ https://land.on.fleek.co/

It's currently under construction, so you might not see much yet. Check back soon if things look a little wonky.

I'm also building JAM stack starters for Fleek, and will be blogging about JAM stack and Fleek moving forward documenting my journey into Web3. The world needs more documentation on JAM stack in Web3, it must be done.

Thanks for stopping in to check out my code.
