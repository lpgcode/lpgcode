- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a JavaScript programmer and web developer. 
- I’m interested in Web3 development, e-commerce, and wherever these two worlds meet. I'm also working on some new concepts for "social" media.
- I’m currently learning Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repos here for dApps and Ethereum smart contracts!

I'm also building JAM stack starters on Fleek, and will be creating instructional blogs going forward. The world needs more documentation for Web3 JAM stack - it must be done. 

Please feel free to clone and reuse any "starters" you see. They will typically be labled as starters or have an active deploy in the README file. 

If you have a JavaScript project you need contributors on, don't hesitate to reach out.

I'm currently looking for career options and contract work in web development. 

If you're interested in hiring me, please contact me anytime at the linked email, or add me on discord:
