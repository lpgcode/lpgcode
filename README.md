- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a fullstack JavaScript programmer and web developer.
- I’m interested in Web3 development & e-commerce.
- I’m currently learning the new Hydrogen framework from Shopify, Web3 & Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites and Ethereum smart contracts!

I'm always up for helping with a JavaScript project. Actively seeking employment and taking contracts for web development. If you need help with the web or JavaScript please contact anytime.
 
Here in this github profile you can find various snippets of work. I try to keep things in here simple for reuse as a personal repo, but will provide links to other outside repos  I'm working on too as they come up. Soon, I'll also be taking the best projects and throwing them all into a portfolio website for easy viewing.
 
 In the meantime you have any questions about my work,
 Contact me @ landongrammer@protonmail.com
 
 Cheers!
