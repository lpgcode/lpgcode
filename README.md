- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Landon Grammer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web3 development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity & Smart Contracts w/ the hardhat framework

 I am also looking to collaborate or work on MERN stack projects, both Web2 and Web3!
 
 Here in this github profile you can find various snippets of work. I try to keep things in here simple for reuse as a personal repo, but will provide links to other outside repos  I'm working on too as they come up.
