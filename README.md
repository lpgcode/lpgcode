- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a fullstack JavaScript programmer and web developer.
- I’m interested in Web3 development & e-commerce.
- I’m currently learning the new Hydrogen framework from Shopify, Web3 & Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites and Ethereum smart contracts!

I'm always up for helping with a JavaScript project. Actively seeking employment and taking contracts for web development. If you need help with a website or anything JavaScript please feel free to reach out.
 
Here in this github profile you can find various snippets of work. I try to keep things in here simple for reuse as a personal repo, but will provide links to other outside repos  I'm working on as they come up. Soon, I'll also be taking the best projects and throwing them all into a portfolio website for easy viewing which will be linked below.
 
 In the meantime if you have any questions about my work or want to talk about a project,
 Contact me @ landongrammer@protonmail.com
 
 Cheers!
