- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a JavaScript programmer and web developer. 
- I’m interested in Web3 development, e-commerce, and wherever these two worlds meet.
- I’m currently learning Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites, dApps, and Ethereum smart contracts!
