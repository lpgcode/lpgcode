- Hello! My name is Landon Grammer, I'm a fullstack/JAMstack JavaScript programmer and web developer.
- I’m interested in Web3 development & e-commerce.
- I’m currently learning Web3 & Solidity. You can probably find lots of test repo's here for SSR websites, dApps, and Ethereum smart contracts!

I'm always up for helping with a JavaScript project. Actively seeking employment and taking contracts for web development. If you need help with a website or anything JavaScript please feel free to reach out.
 
Here in this github profile you can find various snippets of work. When I host a live example for a project I link it in the README of the repo. I try to keep things in here simple for reuse as a defactp personal starter library, but will provide links to other outside projects I'm working on as they come up. Soon, I'll also be taking the best projects and throwing them all into a portfolio website for easy viewing which will be linked here.
 
 In the meantime if you have any questions about my work or want to talk about a project feel free to reach out by email:
